# Markdown
## What is it?
**Markdown** is a way to *mark* text in GitHub so that it looks nice in a web browser, without having to know all of the code that is required on a web page.
## How do I code it?
Rather than knowing a bunch of key words you need to use symbols to mark what will be happening to the text. Some of the symbols may be a bit difficult to remember, ** to indicate **bold** for example.
But other things are much easier to deal with like how to create a table. Just use a hyphen (-) and the pipe symbol (|). This is much easier then the actual coding that must take place in HTML. For example:
| Option | HTML | Markdown |
| ------ | ---- | -------- |
| Table Header | < table > < th> | Enter the items seperated by the pipe symbol, then underline with the hyphen |
| Table Row | < tr > < /tr > | Enter the rows with the pipe symbol |

There are a couple of good resources you can use to find more about the syntax:
