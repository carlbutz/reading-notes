# Summary of Chapter 18

Chapter 18 talks about the **process** of creating a web site and how to **design** web site. 

Before one even starts to create a web site, there are a number of questions they _must_ know the answers to:
1. **Who is my target audience?** Even though I would like to think it is everyone, that is not reality. We need to figure if it is an individual or a company I am targeting. We need to look at age, gender, marital status, number of kids... when looking at individuals. We need to look at size of company, position of people inside the company, and what budget control do they have when looking at companies?
2. **Why are they visiting the site?** Is it for entertainment? Are they trying to accomplish something? Is this for relaxation? Is it essential they are here?
   - What are the visiters trying to achieve?
   - What information do they need?
3. **How often will the vistor return?**
   - Do I need to set a schedule to do updates to the site? For information?  For inventory?
   - Are there parts of the site that need to be updated more frequently?

Once you are able to answer the above questions, it is time to organize your site.
1. **Sitemap** - This will help organize where the pages need to go based on categories.

Home | Contact Info | History | Inventory
---- | ------------ | ------- | ---------
Welcome |  Email, Phone, Address | Beginning | Product Category 1
| | | Last 5 Years | Product Category 2
| | | | Product Category 3
        
2. **Wireframe** - Helps layout how the pages in the site will look<br>

Once you have the basic design, it is now time to get your message out there using some design ideas
1. **Content** - What the visitors are looking for
2. **Priotitizing** - By using these tools, what are you trying to get the visitor to look at?
3. **Organizing** - By using these tools, the site will look pleasing and convey the message in a nice and friendly manner
4. **Visual Hierarchy** - 
   - Size - by using different sizes, the visitor's eyes will be drawn to different areas of the screen
   - Color - by using different colors, you can brand your product by having similar colors. Different colors also help draw a visitor's eyes to certain areas. You do have to be careful so there are not so many colors that the site becomes difficult to read.
5. **Grouping and Similarity** - 
   - Proximity - When items are placed close together, they appear to be more related then items spread out more.
   - Closure - This is a complicated arangement of items, but still in an organized, recognisable pattern.
   - Continuance - When items are placed in line or a curve, just like proximity, they appear to be related. But this also leads from one area to the next.
   - White Space - This is the area that seperates items that are grouped together, giving the appearance that each of the groupings are realated to other items in the group, but not to the other groups.
   - Color - Using a colored back ground brings items together and inter-relates them.
   - Borders - Using a border to outling a group brings items together and inter-relates them.
   
Now that we have the who, the why, the look we need to be able to get visitors from one page to another. To do this, we use **site navigation**. In site navigation, the visitor is able to get back and forth between pages. In order to do this we must be
1. **Be Concise** - Limit the number of options
2. **Be Clear** - Let the visitor know where they are going
3. **Be Selective** - Not everything needs to be in the navigation, maybe have multiple items on a page, if it makes sense
4. **Have Context** - Remind the visitor not only where they are going, but where they currently are in the site
5. **Be Interactive** - Have the links big enough to click on, and have some sort of indication the link is being hovered over and being clicked
6. **Be Consistent** - Try to keep the navigation as simiar from page to page. There may be minor differences, but the majority should be matching.
