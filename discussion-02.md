# Text Editors

The first thing to understand is what is a *text editor*. It is an application that allows a user to enter, edit and save text for a given purpose. Most people are familiar with software like Microsoft Word or Google Doc. Even those are technically text editors, I do not think of them as text editors because their features are designed for making a document look nice with graphics, tables, fonts, colors and the like. I would classify those as word processors. Text editors like Notepad or Notepad++ are what I would consider a true text editor. They are not trying to make a pretty document, but rather have a place to just collect words on a page. This may make text editors seem less powerful or less useful then a word processor, but that is not the case. When a text editor is put together with a browser window, or a program compiler, we can see where their true power lies. When those simple words are put into a text editor, and complied into a web site or a compiler, what comes out can be an extremely powerful program or presentation.

When chosing a text editor, it is important to understand what it will be used for. If all you need is a shopping list, then something basic like Notepad would work. But, if you are trying to write code, you want an editor that will highlight your syntax in different colors to help reduce syntax errors. You will want a editor that allows for different themes, not just to look nice, but to reduce eye strain as well. You will also want a text editor that will grow with you, and add extensions (small programs that work with and inside the text editor) to make your coding more efficient. 

# Terminals

A terminal is a piece of software that allows a user to interact with a computer, but not by using a mouse and icons. Rather, the user types commands and what is called a command prompt. It is those commands that tell the computer what to do. When I started working with computers in the early to mid 1980's that is all we really had, command prompts. So, if you wanted to start your word processor, you type in **word**. If you wanted to create a directory you would type in **mkdir**.

Because there is no pictures to remind you what you were doing, you have to know commands in order to tell the computer what to do. Here are some common commands
