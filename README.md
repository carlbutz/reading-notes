**Growth Mindsets:**
There are two basic types of growth mindsets. The first is a *fixed mindset*. This mindset is set in their ways and is not looking for ways to improve themselves or to grow. The other mindset is the *growth mindset*. This mindset is looking for ways to improve themselves and looking, as its name says, to grow. In the end, a person with a fixed mindset typically does not reach the person's full potential. A person with a growth mindset, typically will acheive more and attain higher goals.

In order to remain in a *Growth Mindset* a person must:
- Learn from criticism rather than ignore the criticism
- Embrace challenges rather than avoiding them
- Be inspired by the success of others rather then view others success as threats
