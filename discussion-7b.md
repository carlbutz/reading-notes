# JavaScript Datatypes

There are seven primitave data types in JS:
1. **Numeric**: a number - 1234
2. **String**: text, surrounded by single or double quotes - 'Hello World!'
3. **Boolean**: true or false
4. **Null**: an empty piece of data, this is not a blank, but no value
5. **Objects**: a variable with many values. An example is var car = {type:'Ford', color:'Blue', model:'Explorer'}
6. **Undefined**: this is when a varible is declared, but no value is assigned to it. This means there is no actual data type assigned to the variable yet.
7. **Arrays**: a group of variable assigned to one variable. An example of this would be var person = ['Carl', 'Butz']

_Arrays_ and _Objects_ may seem similar, but their finctions are different. They both store multiple items in one variable, but the array is to create an ordered list while an object is to describe an item. So, a list of colors would be in an array, and a description of a car would be an object.

# How Computers Work

This is a six part series on how a computer really works. When broken down into the simpliest of thoughts, a computer only does four things:
1. **Input** - recieve information from a user or another computer
2. **Store** - put and receive information from memory.
3. **Process** - Take the information that comes from input and storage, follows directions and manipulates that data
4. **Output** - gives that processed information back to the user or other computer in a user-friendly manner

This is all done with circuits on the _Central Processing Unit (CPU)_. Each circuit is specialized. One may be an _adder_, that is, takes and adds two numbers together. Or, the circuit might be a logic circuit and process an _and_ option to see if both things passed to it are true. If either item is false, and AND circuit will pass back false.

In order to do all this, a computer needs both _hardware_ and _software_. The hardware are the physical pieces of the computer that can be seen and touched. Some pieces of the hardware are the keyboard, the monitore, the hard drive, the CPU. There are many other pieces of hardware, but this is a sample list. Software is the part of the computer you cannot see of touch. Software are the commands given to the hardware to operate. The first, and most important piece of software is the _operating system (OS)_. This is what is loaded first onto the computer, and when the computer is first turned on, into the computer memory. The OS is what allows all other pieces of software to interact with the hardware.
